## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

During this challenge I recaped how to correctly use html and css, learned about global variables in css, default style with margin, padding and box-sizing that those should be removed at the start of the project, as they can mess around with box sizes or margins.

I also learned, that using rems might not be the easiest way to maintain the code as it requires you to calculate it 1 rem= 16px, and that there might be no need to use it anymore as users usually zoom in rather than increase size in browsers.

### Continued development

In the future I will be recapping how to use javascript correctly with html and css together, then I will also be updating my html and css knowledge with newer concepts and ideas.
